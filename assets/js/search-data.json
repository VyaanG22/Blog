Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: Methods or functions . Parameters: INput values of a procedure . Arguments: Specify . Modularity: . Procedural Abstraction: . What are some other names for procedures?: . Why are procedures effective?: . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . def DecimalToBinary(num): strs = &quot;&quot; while num: # if (num &amp; 1) = 1 if (num &amp; 1): strs += &quot;1&quot; # if (num &amp; 1) = 0 else: strs += &quot;0&quot; # right shift by 1 num &gt;&gt;= 1 return strs # function to reverse the string def reverse(strs): print(strs[::-1]) # Driver Code num = 7 print(&quot;Binary of num 7 is:&quot;, end=&quot; &quot;) reverse(DecimalToBinary(num)) . Binary of num 7 is: 111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . def min_max(numbers): #The f before the string indicates that this is an f-string, return (min(numbers), max(numbers)) #which allows you to embed expressions inside string literals. #The {min_value} and {max_value} inside the string are placeholders for the values of the min_value and max_value numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] min_value, max_value = min_max(numbers) print(f&quot;Min: {min_value}, Max: {max_value}&quot;) . Min: 1, Max: 5 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def charToBinary(x): # Convert the character to its ASCII code ascii_code = ord(x) # Convert the ASCII code to binary binary = bin(ascii_code) # Return the binary representation as a string return binary APSCP = &quot;APSCP&quot; for char in APSCP: binary = charToBinary(char) print(binary) binary_list = [] for char in APSCP: binary = charToBinary(char) binary_list.append(binary) # Concatenate the binary strings into a single string binary_string = &#39;&#39;.join(binary_list) print(binary_string) . 0b1000001 0b1010000 0b1010011 0b1000011 0b1010000 0b10000010b10100000b10100110b10000110b1010000 .",

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .

Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables see markdown in rendered format.- On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts . In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | .

            "content": "Hack #1 - Class Notes . In this section, I take my own notes on the section. I have split it up into a vocabulary section and a section for miscellaneous class notes. . Vocabulary Simulations: abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world. (The purpose is drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world.) . Variance: random chance, simulated through random number generation in simulations. . Miscellaneous Class Notes Typically, simulations leave out specific details or simplify complex aspects. It is crucial, however, to have variables to represent variance in the situation. Simulations often contain some amount of bias. Variability and randomness exists inherently in the world, and we can represent this with random number generation. . Here are some helpful functions for these simulations: . import random min = int(input(&quot;WHat is lowest num&quot;)) max = int(input(&quot;HIghest num please&quot;)) x = random.randint(min,max) print(x) . 6 . I entered the numbers 4 and 8 and it found the number in between which is 6. . Why is this simulation considered an abstraction? . It uses a conditional to execute one part of the code only when a particular condition is met. It uses a REPEAT loop to run the same block of code multiple times. It simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. It does not request input from the user or display output to the user. Explanation: The simulation is considered an abstraction because it is represented in separate terms (abstracted) into a computer language, but still made to function in its intended circumstances. . Hack #2 - Functions Classwork . import random x = random.randint(1, 100) print(x) . 9 . Random coin flip . import random def coinflip(): #def function randomflip = random.randint(0, 2) #picks either 0 or 1 randomly (50/50 chance of either) if randomflip == 0 and 1: #assigning 0 to be heads--&gt; if 0 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Heads&quot; print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: if randomflip == 2: #assigning 1 to be tails--&gt; if 1 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Tails&quot; print(&quot;Tails&quot;) #Tossing the coin 5 times: t1 = coinflip() t2 = coinflip() t3 = coinflip() t4 = coinflip() t5 = coinflip() . Heads Heads Heads Tails . import random print(&quot;Please pick the lower bound of the RNG.&quot;) x = int(input()) print(&quot;You picked&quot;, str(x) + &quot;.&quot;) print(&quot;Please pick the upper bound of the RNG.&quot;) y = int(input()) print(&quot;You picked&quot;, str(y) + &quot;.&quot;) print(&quot;Your random number is...&quot;, str(random.randint(x, y)) + &quot;.&quot;) .

I changed the function name to roll_dice and the parameter to num_rolls. I also used a for loop to iterate over the number of rolls instead of a while loop. Additionally, I changed the print statement to print &quot;Dice rolls: &quot; and added a space after each roll when printing the rolls. . import random def roll_dice(num_rolls): dice_rolls = [] for i in range(num_rolls): dice_rolls.append(random.randint(1, 6)) return dice_rolls rolls = roll_dice(5) print(&quot;Dice rolls: &quot;, end=&#39;&#39;) for roll in rolls: print(roll, end=&#39; &#39;) .

Using the questions bank below, create a quiz that presents the user a random question and calculates the user&#39;s score. You can use the template below or make your own. Making your own using a loop can give you extra points. . A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement®︎ classes on students&#39; success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student&#39;s pathway.Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however. answer options: The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias | The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details. | If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation. | The only way for the simulation to be biased is if the researcher intentionally used data that favored their desired output. | | . | Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool.

            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 . NameError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In [2], line 4 2 print(&#34;length of list: &#34;, len(arr1)) 3 s = time.time() -&gt; 4 print(&#34;Index: &#34;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) 5 e = time.time() 6 print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) NameError: name &#39;sequentialSearch&#39; is not defined . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) . Index: False . Challenges and Homework . You have one homework problem. . Yes just one. . Don&#39;t get excited though. . Problem: Given a specific integer N, return the square root of N (R) if N is a perfect square, otherwise, return the square root of N rounded down to the nearest integer . Input: N (Integer) . Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute? Is there some value or rule you can set before applying binary search to narrow the range of possible values? . Run the very last code segment below to load test cases and submission function . def sqrt(N): if N &lt; 2: return N lower = 2 upper = N//2 while lower &lt;= upper: mid = (lower + upper)//2 if (mid**2 == N): return mid elif (mid**2 &lt; N): lower = mid + 1 else: upper = mid - 1 print(sqrt(16)) . 4 . from math import sqrt as sq test_cases = [0,1,4,85248289,22297284,18939904,91107025,69122596,9721924,37810201,1893294144,8722812816,644398225] answers = [int(sq(x)) for x in test_cases] def checkValid(): #checkValid(), which iterates over each of the test cases and answers, for i in range(len(test_cases)): #and checks if the square root of the test case is equal to the corresponding answer. if sqrt(test_cases[i]) == answers[i]: print(&quot;Check number {} passed&quot;.format(i+1)) else: print(&quot;Check number {} failed&quot;.format(i+1)) checkValid() #checkValid() function to run the tests and print out the results. # This code is essentially a simple unit test for the sqrt() function, # which verifies that it is working correctly for the given input values. . 0 Check number 1 passed 1 Check number 2 passed 2 Check number 3 passed 9233 Check number 4 passed 4722 Check number 5 passed 4352 Check number 6 passed 9545 Check number 7 passed 8314 Check number 8 passed 3118 Check number 9 passed 6149 Check number 10 passed 43512 Check number 11 passed 93396 Check number 12 passed 25385 Check number 13 passed .",

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .

Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables see markdown in rendered format.- On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts . In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | .

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .

Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables see markdown in rendered format.- On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts . In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | .

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

I am designing the design to be about basketball. If someone answers incorrectly, I&#39;ll provide a feature that gives them the option of trying again or moving on to the next question. I&#39;ll achieve this with the functions again and next question. Then I&#39;ll make a variable question where I&#39;ll put all my if statements, like if the player clicks correctly, they should go to the right screen, or if they click incorrectly, they should go to the wrong slide. . Managing Complexity: Some of the things I did to handle complexity were to plan everything out beforehand, and if a mistake occurs, I go through the entire code and try to run it to see how it functions before fixing it. Another factor is that if I am having trouble with my code, I would contact a partner for assistance. Additionally, I would go through all of my routines and make sure that my variables matched the names of my screen elements and button or text names. . Review Running example: Instead of having the user browse through all the answers to locate the proper one, I could tell the user who is taking the quiz whether their response is accurate or not. Another step is to write on the last page that you completed the quiz. quiz Function and reason This quiz is about basketball and includes questions regarding the 2022 MVP as well as a few other topics. You have the choice to try again or move on to the next question if you answer the question incorrectly. . Problems that occurred: I had to go over everything, carefully examine everything, and match every screen button and word &quot;Id&quot; into the code because I didn&#39;t get the appropriate variable names or things like capitalization of the buttons or the screen name during the process. It also wouldn&#39;t allow me to see the blocks, so I had to restart my computer and the code for it to work. I eliminated the loop in order to fix the issue because it was also trapped in a loop and the question would not go to the next screen. .",

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .

Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables see markdown in rendered format.- On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts . In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | . Output of the example is much nicer in &quot;jupyter&quot; . cd /tmp file=&quot;sample.md&quot; if [ -f &quot;$file&quot; ]; then rm $file fi tee -a $file &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;EOF # Show Generated Markdown This introductory paragraph and this line and the title above are generated using tee with the standard input (&lt;&lt;) redirection operator. - This bulleted element is still part of the tee body.
