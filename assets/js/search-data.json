Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: Methods or functions . Parameters: INput values of a procedure . Arguments: Specify . Modularity: . Procedural Abstraction: . What are some other names for procedures?: . Why are procedures effective?: . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . def DecimalToBinary(num): strs = &quot;&quot; while num: # if (num &amp; 1) = 1 if (num &amp; 1): strs += &quot;1&quot; # if (num &amp; 1) = 0 else: strs += &quot;0&quot; # right shift by 1 num &gt;&gt;= 1 return strs # function to reverse the string def reverse(strs): print(strs[::-1]) # Driver Code num = 7 print(&quot;Binary of num 7 is:&quot;, end=&quot; &quot;) reverse(DecimalToBinary(num)) . Binary of num 7 is: 111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . def min_max(numbers): #The f before the string indicates that this is an f-string, return (min(numbers), max(numbers)) #which allows you to embed expressions inside string literals. #The {min_value} and {max_value} inside the string are placeholders for the values of the min_value and max_value numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] min_value, max_value = min_max(numbers) print(f&quot;Min: {min_value}, Max: {max_value}&quot;) . Min: 1, Max: 5 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def charToBinary(x): # Convert the character to its ASCII code ascii_code = ord(x) # Convert the ASCII code to binary binary = bin(ascii_code) # Return the binary representation as a string return binary APSCP = &quot;APSCP&quot; for char in APSCP: binary = charToBinary(char) print(binary) binary_list = [] for char in APSCP: binary = charToBinary(char) binary_list.append(binary) # Concatenate the binary strings into a single string binary_string = &#39;&#39;.join(binary_list) print(binary_string) . 0b1000001 0b1010000 0b1010011 0b1000011 0b1010000 0b10000010b10100000b10100110b10000110b1010000 .",

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .

Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables see markdown in rendered format.- On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts . In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | .

            "content": "The schema() function in the code connects to a SQLite database and executes a query to fetch the schema of the &#39;users&#39; table in the database. It then prints the schema to the console. . The purpose of an identity column in SQL database is to automatically generate a unique value for each row in a table. It is commonly used as a primary key for the table. . The purpose of a primary key in SQL database is to uniquely identify each row in a table. It is used to enforce data integrity and to create relationships between tables. . The data types in a SQL table can vary depending on the database system being used, but common data types include integers, decimals, strings, and dates. Other data types include booleans, binary data, and spatial data types. . import sqlite3 database = &#39;files/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? Same for cursor object? Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? . A connection object is a Python object that represents a connection to a database. It is created using a Python library for connecting to a specific database (such as SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and allows the user to perform operations on the database. . A cursor object is a Python object that is used to interact with the database by executing SQL commands. It is created from a connection object and provides methods to execute SQL statements and retrieve the results of queries. . The conn object and cursor object have various attributes that depend on the specific database and Python library being used. In general, the conn object may have attributes such as database, user, host, port, and timeout, while the cursor object may have attributes such as rowcount, description, and arraysize. To see the attributes of these objects in the VSCode debugger, you can use the dir() function or look at the object&#39;s documentation. . There is no results object in the given code, so it cannot be determined whether it is an object or not. . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? Explain try/except, when would except occur? What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? . The if len(password) &lt; 2: statement checks if the length of the updated password is less than 2 characters. If this condition is true, it sets the message variable to &quot;hacked&quot; and changes the password to a hardcoded value of &quot;gothackednewpassword123&quot;. This code is not necessarily malicious, but it is not secure to use a hardcoded password, as it can be easily guessed or hacked. . The try/except block is used to handle exceptions that may occur when executing the SQL command to update data in the database. If an exception occurs during the execution of the try block, the code will jump to the except block to handle the exception. For example, if there is an error with the database connection or syntax error in the SQL command, the except block will be executed to print an error message. . The code that is repeated in each example is related to establishing a connection to the database and creating a cursor object to execute SQL commands. These steps are necessary for any interaction with a SQLite database, so they are repeated in each example to ensure that the necessary connection and cursor objects are created before executing SQL commands. . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #update() . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? . Yes, DELETE operation is considered a dangerous operation as it can permanently remove data from a table, and if executed without proper caution, it can result in significant data loss. The &quot;f&quot; before a string indicates an f-string, which is a string literal that allows embedding expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {} and prefixed by an &quot;f&quot;. {uid} inside the f-string is a variable placeholder that will be replaced with the value of the variable &quot;uid&quot; when the string is formatted. . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? . Why does the menu repeat? . The menu repeats because the menu() function is called recursively at the end of each operation. This means that after completing an operation, the menu is displayed again and the user is prompted to enter another operation. Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? . Yes, the menu can be refactored to use a list of operations and a loop to display the options and handle the user input. Here is an example of how it can be done: . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu . Hacks . Add this Blog to you own Blogging site. In the Blog add notes and observations on each code cell. In this implementation, do you see procedural abstraction? In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture Do you see data abstraction? Complement this with Debugging example. Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project. . Procedural Abstraction . This implementation incorporates a significant amount of procedural abstraction, with functions created to define various procedures in the code, such as create, read, update, and delete. These functions allow for a more generalized approach, enabling information to be added to specific rows of the database. . Data Abstraction . Regarding data abstraction, the code demonstrates the storage of various user attributes, such as their name, password, and date of birth, together in a user-specific uid. This uid is critical in functions like update and delete, as it enables the removal or modification of data based on the unique user identification. . .

Lossless image . . Lossless image compression reduces the size of digital images without losing any data or quality. It identifies patterns and redundancies in the image data, encoding them using fewer bits, resulting in a smaller file size. The original image is perfectly reconstructed when decompressed. . Lossy Image . . Lossy image compression is a method of reducing the size of digital images by removing some image data, resulting in some loss of image quality. It achieves smaller file sizes by discarding non-essential visual information that is less noticeable to the human eye. The amount of data that is removed determines the degree of compression and the resulting loss of quality. Lossy compression is often used in scenarios where image quality is not as critical, such as in web graphics and digital photography. . . . . .",

            "content": "Crowd Sourcing . To initiate a crowdsource project in a Computer Science classroom with 150 students, I would create a platform for students to submit their ideas, such as a shared online document or forum, and encourage participation by explaining the benefits of crowdsourcing, such as increased creativity and innovation. To make the N@tM (Night at the Museum) event more interesting, I would capture data on attendance, popular exhibits, visitor feedback, and engagement to show my understanding of visitor behavior and engagement. . Computing Bias . To avoid bias in algorithms, it is important to focus on unbiased data selection and preprocessing, fair algorithm design, diverse model validation, and model explainability. By doing so, the algorithm will be less prone to discrimination and more likely to produce fair and ethical outcomes that accurately reflect the target population. . Benefical and Harmful Effects . Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Beneficial Effect: Improved communication and connectivity through the use of social media and messaging apps. Harmful Effect: Increased risk of cyberbullying and decreased face-to-face communication skills. . Beneficial Effect: Increased access to information and educational resources through the use of the internet. Harmful Effect: Decreased attention span and ability to focus due to constant distractions and a constant stream of information. . Beneficial Effect: Increased productivity through the use of productivity tools and software. Harmful Effect: Decreased physical activity and increased risk of repetitive strain injuries from prolonged computer use. . Regarding the dopamine issue, dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in motivation and reward. The overuse of technology and social media can lead to an overstimulation of the reward center in the brain, leading to addiction-like behaviors. This can be a real issue for some people and can impact their personal study and success in high school. However, it is not a &quot;parent conspiracy&quot; but rather an issue that can arise from the overuse of technology. . Digital Divide . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . To empower oneself in a digital world, one should seek out resources and opportunities to learn about technology and its various uses. Building digital literacy skills and becoming proficient in the use of technology can help one gain confidence and control in a digital environment. . An empowered individual can help someone who is not empowered by sharing their knowledge and resources, and by providing support and guidance. For example, at Del Norte HS, an empowered student could volunteer to teach a digital literacy class or mentor a peer who is struggling with technology. . Barriers to digital empowerment can include lack of access to technology, lack of training and education, and outdated systems and policies. It is not clear whether such barriers exist at Del Norte HS specifically, but they do exist in many places. It is important to identify and address these barriers to ensure equitable access to digital resources and opportunities. .",

            "content": "Hack #1 - Class Notes . In this section, I take my own notes on the section. I have split it up into a vocabulary section and a section for miscellaneous class notes. . Vocabulary Simulations: abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world. (The purpose is drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world.) . Variance: random chance, simulated through random number generation in simulations. . Miscellaneous Class Notes Typically, simulations leave out specific details or simplify complex aspects. It is crucial, however, to have variables to represent variance in the situation. Simulations often contain some amount of bias. Variability and randomness exists inherently in the world, and we can represent this with random number generation. . Here are some helpful functions for these simulations: . import random min = int(input(&quot;WHat is lowest num&quot;)) max = int(input(&quot;HIghest num please&quot;)) x = random.randint(min,max) print(x) . 6 . I entered the numbers 4 and 8 and it found the number in between which is 6. . Why is this simulation considered an abstraction? . It uses a conditional to execute one part of the code only when a particular condition is met. It uses a REPEAT loop to run the same block of code multiple times. It simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. It does not request input from the user or display output to the user. Explanation: The simulation is considered an abstraction because it is represented in separate terms (abstracted) into a computer language, but still made to function in its intended circumstances. . Hack #2 - Functions Classwork . import random x = random.randint(1, 100) print(x) . 9 . Random coin flip . import random def coinflip(): #def function randomflip = random.randint(0, 2) #picks either 0 or 1 randomly (50/50 chance of either) if randomflip == 0 and 1: #assigning 0 to be heads--&gt; if 0 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Heads&quot; print(&quot;Heads&quot;) else: if randomflip == 2: #assigning 1 to be tails--&gt; if 1 is chosen then it will print, &quot;Tails&quot; print(&quot;Tails&quot;) #Tossing the coin 5 times: t1 = coinflip() t2 = coinflip() t3 = coinflip() t4 = coinflip() t5 = coinflip() .

            "title": "Searching Introduction",
            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 . NameError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In [2], line 4 2 print(&#34;length of list: &#34;, len(arr1)) 3 s = time.time() -&gt; 4 print(&#34;Index: &#34;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) 5 e = time.time() 6 print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) NameError: name &#39;sequentialSearch&#39; is not defined . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .

Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables see markdown in rendered format.- On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts . In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | .

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .

Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables see markdown in rendered format.- On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts . In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | . Output of the example is much nicer in &quot;jupyter&quot; . cd /tmp file=&quot;sample.md&quot; if [ -f &quot;$file&quot; ]; then rm $file fi tee -a $file &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;EOF # Show Generated Markdown This introductory paragraph and this line and the title above are generated using tee with the standard input (&lt;&lt;) redirection operator. - This bulleted element is still part of the tee body.

I am designing the design to be about basketball. If someone answers incorrectly, I&#39;ll provide a feature that gives them the option of trying again or moving on to the next question. I&#39;ll achieve this with the functions again and next question. Then I&#39;ll make a variable question where I&#39;ll put all my if statements, like if the player clicks correctly, they should go to the right screen, or if they click incorrectly, they should go to the wrong slide. . Managing Complexity: Some of the things I did to handle complexity were to plan everything out beforehand, and if a mistake occurs, I go through the entire code and try to run it to see how it functions before fixing it. Another factor is that if I am having trouble with my code, I would contact a partner for assistance. Additionally, I would go through all of my routines and make sure that my variables matched the names of my screen elements and button or text names. . Review Running example: Instead of having the user browse through all the answers to locate the proper one, I could tell the user who is taking the quiz whether their response is accurate or not. Another step is to write on the last page that you completed the quiz. quiz Function and reason This quiz is about basketball and includes questions regarding the 2022 MVP as well as a few other topics. You have the choice to try again or move on to the next question if you answer the question incorrectly. . Problems that occurred: I had to go over everything, carefully examine everything, and match every screen button and word &quot;Id&quot; into the code because I didn&#39;t get the appropriate variable names or things like capitalization of the buttons or the screen name during the process. It also wouldn&#39;t allow me to see the blocks, so I had to restart my computer and the code for it to work. I eliminated the loop in order to fix the issue because it was also trapped in a loop and the question would not go to the next screen. .",

Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes hav relationship with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an &quot;env&quot; command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . &quot;env&quot; show setting for your shell | &quot;git clone&quot; sets up a director of files | &quot;cd $project&quot; allows user to move inside that directory of files | &quot;.git&quot; is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env .

Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables see markdown in rendered format.- On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts . In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | . Output of the example is much nicer in &quot;jupyter&quot; . cd /tmp file=&quot;sample.md&quot; if [ -f &quot;$file&quot; ]; then rm $file fi tee -a $file &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;EOF # Show Generated Markdown This introductory paragraph and this line and the title above are generated using tee with the standard input (&lt;&lt;) redirection operator. - This bulleted element is still part of the tee body. EOF echo &quot;- This bulleted element and lines below are generated using echo with standard output (&gt;&gt;) redirection operator.&quot; &gt;&gt; $file echo &quot;- The list definition, as is, is using space to seperate lines.
