    <h1>Final College Board Corrections</h1>
    <h2> Score: 47/50</h2>

    <h2> Question: 34</h2>
    <h3> Consider the following code segment.

        firstList ← ["guitar", "drums", "bass"]
        
        secondList ← ["flute", "violin"]
        
        thirdList ← []
        
        thirdList ← firstList
        
        firstList ← secondList
        
        secondList ← thirdList
        
        What are the contents of secondList after the code segment is executed?</h3>

        <p> The correct answer is B because The code segment initializes firstList to contain 
            ["guitar", "drums", "bass"], secondList to contain ["flute", "violin"], 
            and thirdList to contain an empty list. The code segment then swaps
             the contents of firstList and secondList by assigning firstList to
              thirdList, then secondList to firstList, then thirdList to secondList.</p>

    <h2> Question: 38</h2>
    <h3> Three words are stored in the variables word1, word2, and word3. The values of the variables are to be updated as shown in the following table.

        Variable	Value Before
        Updating	Value After
        Updating
        word1	"xylophone"	"zebra"
        word2	"yarn"	"yarn"
        word3	"zebra"	"xylophone"
        Which of the following code segments can be used to update the values of the variables as shown in the table?</h3>
    
    <p> The correct answer is B because The first statement assigns the value of word1 to 
        the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of word3 to word1.
         The third statement assigns the original value of word1, which is stored in temp, to word3. The original values of word1 
        and word3 are interchanged, which reverses the values of the variables as intended.</p>
    
    <h2> Question: 41</h2>
    <h2> The correct answer is B because Correct. 
        The first four statements assign values to the variables. The fifth 
        statement assigns the value of q (which is 20) to p. The sixth statement 
        assigns the value of r (which is 30) to q. The seventh statement assigns the 
        value of q (which is 30) to s. The last statement assigns the value of p (which is 20) to r. 
        Therefore, r has the value 20. After executing the code segment, the value of p is 20, the value of 
        q is 30, the value of r is 20, and the value of s is 30.
