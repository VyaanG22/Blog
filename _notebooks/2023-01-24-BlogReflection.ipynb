    "# Crowd Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "To initiate a crowdsource project in a Computer Science classroom with 150 students, I would create a platform for students to submit their ideas, such as a shared online document or forum, and encourage participation by explaining the benefits of crowdsourcing, such as increased creativity and innovation. To make the N@tM (Night at the Museum) event more interesting, I would capture data on attendance, popular exhibits, visitor feedback, and engagement to show my understanding of visitor behavior and engagement."

    "\n",
    "To avoid bias in algorithms, it is important to focus on unbiased data selection and preprocessing, fair algorithm design, diverse model validation, and model explainability. By doing so, the algorithm will be less prone to discrimination and more likely to produce fair and ethical outcomes that accurately reflect the target population."

    "Harmful Effect: Increased risk of cyberbullying and decreased face-to-face communication skills.\n",

    "Beneficial Effect: Increased access to information and educational resources through the use of the internet.\n",

    "Beneficial Effect: Increased productivity through the use of productivity tools and software.\n",
    "Harmful Effect: Decreased physical activity and increased risk of repetitive strain injuries from prolonged computer use.\n",

    "Regarding the dopamine issue, dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in motivation and reward. The overuse of technology and social media can lead to an overstimulation of the reward center in the brain, leading to addiction-like behaviors. This can be a real issue for some people and can impact their personal study and success in high school. However, it is not a \"parent conspiracy\" but rather an issue that can arise from the overuse of technology."

    "\n",
    "An empowered individual can help someone who is not empowered by sharing their knowledge and resources, and by providing support and guidance. For example, at Del Norte HS, an empowered student could volunteer to teach a digital literacy class or mentor a peer who is struggling with technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Barriers to digital empowerment can include lack of access to technology, lack of training and education, and outdated systems and policies. It is not clear whether such barriers exist at Del Norte HS specifically, but they do exist in many places. It is important to identify and address these barriers to ensure equitable access to digital resources and opportunities."
