    "Regarding the dopamine issue, dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in motivation and reward. The overuse of technology and social media can lead to an overstimulation of the reward center in the brain, leading to addiction-like behaviors. This can be a real issue for some people and can impact their personal study and success in high school. However, it is not a \"parent conspiracy\" but rather an issue that can arise from the overuse of technology."

    "To empower oneself in a digital world, one should seek out resources and opportunities to learn about technology and its various uses. Building digital literacy skills and becoming proficient in the use of technology can help one gain confidence and control in a digital environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "An empowered individual can help someone who is not empowered by sharing their knowledge and resources, and by providing support and guidance. For example, at Del Norte HS, an empowered student could volunteer to teach a digital literacy class or mentor a peer who is struggling with technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Barriers to digital empowerment can include lack of access to technology, lack of training and education, and outdated systems and policies. It is not clear whether such barriers exist at Del Norte HS specifically, but they do exist in many places. It is important to identify and address these barriers to ensure equitable access to digital resources and opportunities."
