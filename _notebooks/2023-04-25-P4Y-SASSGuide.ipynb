    "### In your own words, explain what SASS does:\n",
    "SASS is a preprocessor scripting language used to simplify the process of writing and managing CSS code. It allows developers to use variables, nesting, functions, and mixins, which are not available in CSS. SASS is compiled into CSS, which is then used to style HTML elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some benefits to SASS?: \n",
    "Improved code organization and reusability\n",
    "Faster development time and easier maintenance\n",
    "Reduced code redundancy and file size\n",
    "Flexibility in defining styles using variables, functions, and mixins\n",
    "Ability to create complex animations and effects using built-in functions and libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Describe/Explain one of the more \"advanced\" SASS properties below in detail:\n",
    "- One of the more advanced SASS properties is the @extend directive. This allows a selector to inherit styles from another selector, reducing the amount of CSS code needed. When an element is extended, it inherits all the styles of the original selector, and any changes to the original selector's styles will be applied to the extended selector as well.\n",

    "## [Link to Number Guesser Game](https://anicricket.github.io/tmv4/_pages/numberguesser_v3.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the number guesser game work?\n",
    "- The number guesser game generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess the number. After each guess, the game tells the user if their guess is too high or too low and keeps track of the number of guesses. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game ends and displays the number of guesses it took to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explain how SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing?\n",
    "- SASS can be used to make the number guesser game look more visually appealing by defining variables for commonly used values like colors, font sizes, and spacing. This allows for consistent styling throughout the game and makes it easy to update the styles in one place. SASS nesting can also be used to organize styles and improve readability. Additionally, SASS mixins can be used to define reusable styles for things like buttons and form elements."
