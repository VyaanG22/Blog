    "Before performing any mathematical operations in binary, it is crucial to understand how binary numbers interact with each other. For instance, when subtracting binary numbers, it is essential to know that 0-0 equals 0, 1-1 equals 0, 0-1 equals 1, and 1-0 equals 1. Failure to understand these rules can make it impossible to perform accurate calculations. To determine the difference between two binary numbers, one can use the binary subtraction method, which requires borrowing 1 from the next higher bit when the minuend digit is less than the corresponding subtrahend digit. Similarly, when multiplying two binary numbers, one can use the binary multiplication method by multiplying each bit of the multiplier with every bit of the multiplicand and adding the results. For binary division, the binary division method is used, which involves subtracting the divisor from the dividend repeatedly while shifting both the quotient and remainder to the left until the remainder is less than the divisor. In binary arithmetic, specific rules must be followed, such as carrying over 1 to the next higher bit if the sum of two binary digits is 2 and using the two's complement of a binary number to represent negative values."
