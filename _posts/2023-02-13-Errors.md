<p>For my SQL database. My issue with this database was I wrote the code, and when I tried to run the code using the main.py, the sql database wasn't created. For reference I used google to attempt to fix this issue, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/how-to-fix-errors?view=sql-server-ver16">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/how-to-fix-errors?view=sql-server-ver16</a>. I tried to follow the instructions in the article but my issue wasnt able to get resolved. I have attempted to fix this multiple times, but to no avail. For the final project I will be doing more work to fix including talking to other people in my group so that I can finally fix this.</p>
